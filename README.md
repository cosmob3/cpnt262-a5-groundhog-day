- X Find or create an array of items of your choice. See this Gist for examples.
- X Declare an empty string variable called output or similar.
- X Loop through each item of the array using a loop statement of your choice (i.e. for loop or Array.forEach() method).
- X Using the loop and the addition assignment (+=) operator, add each item to the output variable. You must change the item in some way, such as:
  - X add HTML to create a numbered or bulleted list;
  <!-- - capitalize each word; -->
  - X build links to other websites;
  <!-- - etc. -->
- X At the end of the loop, assign the value of the output variable to a page element of your choice.

It all started well. Added my loop and my array. But when I was trying to console.log my array. It wasn't working and I couldn't figure out why. Eventually I noticed that I was using parentheses instead of square brackets... 

Silly mistakes!

Used the favoutireTvshows array that we made earlier in the week.

Was not too sure how to attatch my array to my loop so I went back to the Loops day video from class. 

The addition assignment operator `(+=)` makes sense to me but I rather do it the long way to better visualize what is going on. At least for now while I'm still new.

Made the array into a list of links (double marks ;) jk)

I was a bit overwhelmed at the beginning of this achievement for some reason but it wasn't that bad. 

Tried to add some CSS... Besides `margin` most of the other styles that I was trying to add were messing up the page so I just took them out for now. 

**Refrection:** Breaking up my coding into multiple smaller sessions seems to work best for me. My brain is able to rest and I feel like I can even stay on task a lot better.
