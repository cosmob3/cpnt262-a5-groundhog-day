- Find or create an array of items of your choice. See this Gist for examples.
- Declare an empty string variable called output or similar.
- Loop through each item of the array using a loop statement of your choice (i.e. for loop or Array.forEach() method).
- Using the loop and the addition assignment (+=) operator, add each item to the output variable. You must change the item in some way, such as:
  - add HTML to create a numbered or bulleted list;
  - capitalize each word;
  - build links to other websites;
  - etc.
-At the end of the loop, assign the value of the output variable to a page element of your choice.
